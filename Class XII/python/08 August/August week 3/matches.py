#Write a function called matches that takes two strings as arguments and returns how many matches there are between the strings.
#A match is where the two strings have the same character at the same index. For instance, 'python' and 'path' match in the Ô¨Årst, third, and fourth characters, so the function should return 3.

    suma = 0
    x = len(a)
    y = len(b)
    if x <= y:
        for i in range(0, x):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                suma = suma + 1
    else:
        for i in range(0, y):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                suma = suma + 1
