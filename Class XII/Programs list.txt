Program list:

->1) write a program to read a number and check if it is an armstrong number create a function cntdig that recieves the number and counts the number of digits. arm function recieves a number and checks if its armstrong number.

->2) write a function that recieves a number and checks whether its a prime number or not. read a number x and check all primes between 2 and x.

3) write a function that takes 2 numbers and returns a number that has a smaller ones digit. default values for numbers are 158 and 233. call function in all possible ways

->4) write a function that recieves a number and checks if it is a perfect number. write a function test that recieves starting value(11) and ending value(20) which calls the first function.

5) write a function calc that recieves 2 numbers and returns the sum, difference and product as elements of a tuple and it returns values as independent variables

6) write a function to read the length breadth and height of a cuboid and return its volume

7) write a function swap taht recieves 2 integers and swaps their values. print swapped values in function and in program after fn is called

8) write a program that generates  series using function that takes first and last values of series and generates 4 terms that ar equidistant eg. 2 nos passed are 1 and 7, then series is 1 3 5 7

9)write a function check that recieves a string and returns the number of upper case characters, lower case characters and digits, puts count in a dictionary and returns a dictionary.

10) write a function check that recieves a number and returns its factorial. write a function check2 that recieves a number and checks if the number is a factorian. In main print a list of all factorians between 100 and 999.(number for which sum of factorial of digits is the number itself)

->11)write a function which recieves a value n and generates the first n lines of pascals triangle in a list

->12) write a function to sort the list of numbers in ascending order

->13) write a function that performs binary search of a number on a list

->14) write a function that recieves a sorted list and inserts the element in right place in ascending/descending order

15) write a program to read a list of 10 elements. sort the list. read an item to be deleted. find position of item using binary search. delete the item. print the deleted list.

->16) write a menu driven program to add, subtract, multiply, transpose, find sum of both diagonal's elements, print the upper and lower triangle. read the no of rows and columns for the two matirces and perform above mentioned  

->17) menu driven program for stack operations

->18) read a number, convert to binary, push to stack and display

->19)create a stack to perform push and pop operations and a third operation find min which returns smallest element on the stack

->20) evaluate postfix expression using stack

21)menu driven program for queue operations

22) a program to implement 3 queues highestpr, normalpr, lowestpr: the program accepts element alongwith its priority

23) read two lists A and B, write a function that returns a list that contains only yhe elements that are common to both the lists

->24) a list represents the date of visits of each patient of a clinic. find the patient with most visits

25) write a function that recieves a lsit and returns the number of elements that are unique in this list

->26) write a program to read a file and count number of lines starting with w or ending with e.

27) write a program to read a file and count the number of line and count the number of vowels

28) write a program to read a file and count the number of words that contain letter e

->29) write a fucntion that reads a file and copies all lines that do not start with a lower case letter onto another file

30) write a program to read 2 filenames and append the contents of first file to second file

31) write a rpogram to read the number of uppercase and lowercase characters in a data file

->32) write a program to count the no of occurences of "to" and "the" in a data file

33) write a program to create a file and write marks of students, then read the file again to and print name of student who has passed

->34) write a program to copy contents of  a source file to destination file if either dont exist, abandon operation

->35) Project data file handling

36) Write a function called matches that takes two strings as arguments and returns how many matches there are between the strings

->37) csv file editing
 
->38) Mysql python connector

->39) Binary File operations
